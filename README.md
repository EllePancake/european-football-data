# 25k+ Matches Football Database Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the Ultimate 25k+ Matches Football Database, aiming to uncover insights. The analysis focuses on understanding league dynamics, team performances, scoring patterns, home advantage, and predictive modeling of match outcomes.

## Objectives
- Identify key opportunities for data analysis in the context of European football.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's underlying patterns and relationships.
- Perform statistical inference to test hypotheses related to football matches and scoring.
- Develop predictive models for forecasting match outcomes and team performances.

## Data
The dataset encompasses over 25,000 football matches from various European leagues, detailing match outcomes, team performances, and league information. Key attributes include match dates, team names, goals scored, and extensive in-game statistics.

## Methodology
The project methodology includes data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, and predictive modeling. Key steps involve:
- Cleaning data and engineering relevant features to support analysis.
- Performing EDA to uncover trends and patterns in leagues, teams, and matches.
- Using statistical tests to validate hypotheses related to match outcomes and scoring.
- Developing linear regression models to predict goals scored and match winners.
- Visualizing data and findings to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.

## Key Findings
- Analysis of league and country associations revealed distinct scoring patterns, indicating varying levels of competitiveness and play styles.
- Investigation into home advantage confirmed its presence across multiple leagues, with home teams generally performing better.
- Predictive models for goals scored and match outcomes demonstrated potential for forecasting, albeit with room for improvement in accuracy and reliability.

## Dashboard
A dashboard comprising multiple visualizations was created to provide interactive insights into the dataset.
